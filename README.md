# wekun-api

This repo is an excercise to show the result of my [master's thesis](https://github.com/tiramirez/msc-eng-thesis) in an interactive way. The main functionalities I am working on are:
* Select Images by their ID and get their scores and percentile.
* Upload a new image, process the image (segmentation and Object detection), and calculate new scores.

The app is designed in DjangoREST.
